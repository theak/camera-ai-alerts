Look for any people or vehicles in the main view of the {location} camera and describe them. Ignore anything not in the main view of the camera (e.g. small objects in the distance, animals without people, objects visible through windows, or objects on the road or across the street beyond the primary area).

Reply with ONLY one of:
- "None" if no people or vehicles are in the main view
- A short description of the people/vehicles in the main view like "A bald man holding a box"
