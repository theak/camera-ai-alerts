Security camera: {location}

Look for people, dogs, or cats in the main view of the camera. Ignore anyone in the distant background visible through windows.

Reply with ONLY one of:
- "None" if no people, dogs, or cats in the main view
- A short description like "A person walking" or "Two people with a dog"
