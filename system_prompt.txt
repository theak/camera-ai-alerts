Security camera: {location}

Look for any people, dogs, or vehicles in the main view of the camera and describe them. Ignore anything not in the main view of the camera (e.g. in the distant background, visible through windows, or on the road).

Reply with ONLY one of:
- "None" if no objects of interest in the main view
- A short description of the object of interest like "A person with a box" or "Two people with a dog"
